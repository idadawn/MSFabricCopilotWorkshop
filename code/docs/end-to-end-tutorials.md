# End-to-end tutorials in Microsoft Fabric

In this article, you find a comprehensive list of end-to-end tutorials available in Microsoft Fabric. These tutorials guide you through a scenario that covers the entire process, from data acquisition to data consumption. They're designed to help you develop a foundational understanding of the Fabric UI, the various experiences supported by Fabric and their integration points, and the professional and citizen developer experiences that are available.

## Multi-experience tutorials

The following table lists tutorials that span multiple Fabric experiences.

|Tutorial name  |Scenario |
|---------|---------|
|[Lakehouse](../data-engineering/tutorial-lakehouse-introduction.md) | In this tutorial, you ingest, transform, and load the data of a fictional retail company, Wide World Importers, into the lakehouse and analyze sales data across various dimensions.  |
|[Data Science](../data-science/tutorial-data-science-introduction.md)    |  In this tutorial, you explore, clean, and transform a taxicab trip dataset, and build a machine learning model to predict trip duration at scale on a large dataset.   |
|[Real-Time Analytics](../real-time-analytics/tutorial-introduction.md)   | In this tutorial, you use the streaming and query capabilities of Real-Time Analytics to analyze the New York Yellow Taxi trip dataset. You uncover essential insights into trip statistics, taxi demand across the boroughs of New York, and other related insights. |
|[Data warehouse](../data-warehouse/tutorial-introduction.md) |  In this tutorial, you build an end-to-end data warehouse for the fictional Wide World Importers company. You ingest data into data warehouse, transform it using T-SQL and pipelines, run queries, and build reports. |

## Experience-specific tutorials

The following tutorials walk you through scenarios within specific Fabric experiences.

|Tutorial name  |Scenario |
|---------|---------|
|[Power BI](/power-bi/fundamentals/fabric-get-started) |  In this tutorial, you build a dataflow and pipeline to bring data into a lakehouse, create a dimensional model, and generate a compelling report. |
|[Data Factory](../data-factory/tutorial-end-to-end-introduction.md) | In this tutorial, you ingest data with data pipelines and transform data with dataflows, then use the automation and notification to create a complete data integration scenario. |
| [Data Science end-to-end AI samples](../data-science/use-ai-samples.md) | In this set of tutorials, learn about the different Data Science experience capabilities and examples of how ML models can address your common business problems. |
| [Data Science - Price prediction with R](../data-science/r-avocado.md) | In this tutorial, you build a machine learning model to analyze and visualize the avocado prices in the US and predict future prices. |
